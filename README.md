# Kraken
Welcome to the (unofficial) Kraken Android App.  
This project tries to fill the gap between Kraken.com and Android.  
The app is built with the Ionic Framework (based itself on Cordova and AngularJS), allowing it to be ported easyly to other platforms (Windows Phone, Blackberry, iOS, etc.)

This is an early release. So far it has been tested on a LG Nexus 4 and gives the following features :
 - API keys scanning through com.phonegap.plugins.barcodescanner
 - Balances for all currencies
 - History
 - Trading on all tradable pairs

About licencing : work in progress ! Right now, consider it as GPL v3.
